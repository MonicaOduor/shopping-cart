# Marcello
Welcome to Marcello, a simple and easy-to-use application for ordering pizza online!

This shopping cart is built with React and TypeScript, and uses the Context API for managing state. Local storage is also implemented to save the user's cart items even after the page is refreshed.

## Demo
You can try out the shopping cart by visiting the deployed version at [https://shopping-cart-smoky-tau.vercel.app/].

  cd shopping-cart
  npm install
  
3. Start the development server:
